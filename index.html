			About
		</h2>
		<p>
		Forbes Thor Kiddoo came to San Francisco in 1959 after a stint in the Coast Guard. A carpenter and engineer, he developed a business constructing houseboats in Sausalito. Then, inspired by Jules Verne’s Captain Nemo and the movie version of “20,000 Leagues Under The Sea”, Forbes Kiddoo built himself an underwater home, complete with potholes for watching the fish swim past and underwater diving hatch, and a grand bedroom suite fit for a captain of his own private world. In the 90’s Forbes added a 40 foot lighthouse and a white picket fence.

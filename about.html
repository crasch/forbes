		<p>The English Tudor paneling on the interior walls of the island is decorated with tight fitted molding which is secured with no nails or glue. The molding, if pieced together, would span more than 10,000 feet or nearly 2 miles.

		The antique ship's wheel in the wheelhouse was from the Brigatine, Regina Maris, built in 1906 and she rounded Cape Horn 17 times.

		The island is powered by an actual Sea Mule motor, which is the world's largest outboard motor and was used extensively in World War II by the US Navy to propel ocean going barges. It can rotate 360 degrees and is a 250 horse power motor.

		<p>Forbes Island displaces 700 tons of water, the structure was made with 280 tons of concrete, 120 tons of rocks surround the perimeter, 90 tons of sand top the shores, and 40 tons of topsoil are the earth for the plants and palms.

		During the spring the Washatona Palm Trees are the nesting grounds for hundreds of Starling blackbirds and the rocks around the perimeter of the island are the nesting grounds of several seagulls.

		Forbes Island launched on December 23, 1980. On launch day the island had 3 staterooms all with private baths, 56 portholes throughout, and the waterfall cascaded into a hot tub. Shortly thereafter it was featured on "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" and "That's Incredible"
